def pansharpen(scene, panchromatic, weights=(1, 1, 0.2)):
    """
    Pansharpen the red, green, and blue bands of a scene.

    The pansharpened scene will have the same coordinate values of the given
    panchromatic band. Uses a weighted version of the Brovey Transform
    [Pohl_and_VanGenderen1998]_ to account for the smaller blue footprint in
    Landsat 8/9 panchromatic band, following
    https://github.com/mapbox/rio-pansharpen (MIT license).

    Parameters
    ----------
    scene : :class:`xarray.Dataset`
        A Landsat scene, as read with :func:`xlandsat.load_scene`. The scene
        must contain the red, green, and blue bands. Other bands are ignored.
    panchromatic : :class:`xarray.DataArray`
        A Landsat panchromatic band, as read with
        :func:`xlandsat.load_panchromatic`.
    weights : tuple
        The weights applied to the red, green, and blue bands, respectively.

    Returns
    -------
    scene_sharpened : :class:`xarray.Dataset`
        The pandsharpened scene including the red, green, and blue bands only.
        Metadata from the original scene is copied into the pandsharpened
        version.
