# Authorship guidelines for software papers and software archives

Our goal for this document is to establish guidelines for giving credit to
contributors for their work. To do so, we will attempt to define:

- Fair and diverse ways of providing recognition for contributors' efforts.
- Define _contributions_ in a broad way: writing code and/or documentation,
  providing ideas, fostering the community, etc.

The following are the ways in which individuals who have contributed will be
recognized.

> **Note**: These policies are not set in stone and may be changed to
> accommodate the growth of the project or the preferences of the community.

> **Note:** This document is based on the
> [Fatiando a Terra authorship guidelines](https://github.com/fatiando/community/blob/main/AUTHORSHIP.md)


## Changelog for each release

Every time we make a release, everyone who has made a commit to the repository
since the previous release will be mentioned in the changelog entry. This is a
way of saying "Thank you".


## The `AUTHORS.md` file

Anyone who has contributed a pull request to the project is welcome to **add
themselves to the `AUTHORS.md` file**. This file lives in the repository and is
packaged with distributions.

This is an optional process and is **opt-in**. Names and affiliations will be
sourced from this file for publishing source code archives.


## Authorship on Zenodo archives of releases

Anyone who has contributed to the repository (i.e., appears on `git log`) will
be included as an author on the Zenodo source code archive of new releases.

To be included as an author, you must add the following to the `AUTHORS.md`
file of the repository:

1. Full name
2. Affiliation (if omitted, we will use "Unaffiliated")
3. ORCID (optional)

If you have contributed and **do not wish to be included** in Zenodo archives,
there are a few options:

1. Don't add yourself to `AUTHORS.md`
2. Remove yourself from `AUTHORS.md`
3. Indicate next to your name on `AUTHORS.md` that you do not wish to be
   included with something like `(not included in Zenodo)`.


## Scientific publications (papers)

We aim to write academic papers for most of your software packages. Ideally, we
will publish updated papers for major changes or large new components of the
package.

To be included as an author on the paper, you must satisfy the following
criteria:

1. Have made a contribution to the repository or significant non-coding
   contributions.
2. Add your full name, affiliation, and ORCID to the paper. These can be
   submitted by pull requests to the corresponding paper repository.
3. Write and/or read and review the manuscript in a timely manner and provide
   comments on the paper (even if it's just an "OK", but preferably more).

The order of authors will be decided on a case-by-case basis by open discussion
with the authors.
